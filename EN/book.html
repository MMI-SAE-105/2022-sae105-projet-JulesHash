            There are several reasons why I particularly wanted to mention these two iconic characters, 
            present among the other examples cited in the book I decided to present to you. They are both rich, powerful, 
            at the head of very large companies qualified by the author of “Empires”, but they are also in the same field of activity, namely digital.

            I first decided to present this book because it is in complete agreement with the ambition. 
            In addition, it allows the subject to be refocused on relatively concrete examples.<br>
            I then concentrated on Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.<br>
            Bill Gates is a figure who fascinated me as a young man, but also inspired me. 
            "But this man works on a computer all day and he has a lot of money!" I said, from my 10th birthday. 
            Jules, it’s not that simple.<br>

            Indeed, through the book by Jean Claude Papillon published in 2002 and edited by «Management et Société», 
            The term Empire perfectly represents the notion of a powerful big company that are each specific to each character in the book. 
            The timeline is wide: from 1800 to the present day, from Louis Hachette to John Rockefeller to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to Jeffrey Bezos, 
            the examples of ambitions that have become reality are vast.

    <h6>Portrait of John Davidson Rockefeller (1839-1937), of American nationality, the first billionaire industrialist in history, who made his fortune through oil, a pioneer in the family tree of the Rockefeller family, a personality that has fascinated me with its ability to act and which is today one of my major success stories</h6>

            Finally, it should be noted that the site does not only address the concept of money, 
            and points out that this is not the main starting value. The author also has an optimistic writing 
            about when he tells the story of examples. It also pushes into the details of their lives to better 
            understand them rather than just agreeing on numbers and the company itself. Throughout the reading we keep 
            a historical aspect by appropriating the world economic situation during the periods located. O
            ur gaze is not based solely on the characters.

            So take inspiration from the greatest, but do not put yourself in harm’s way when your destiny does not resemble theirs. 
            Notice that progress doesn’t have a single curve, the line of your existence can remain constant for a while like taking a sharp turn. 
            The important thing is to stay on course. Stay on the road to your goals, keep the map in mind.

            What if this set of threads could perfectly represent the idea of success? Indeed, 
            not everyone will succeed in the same way. For some, the path will be fraught with obstacles, 
            for others much less. The others will have a difficult start, while it will be the opposite for you... 
            The important thing is to find your way and not take the same path as others, trust yourself ! 
            Don’t duplicate success patterns, create your own! Good luck to all those who will launch after seeing this article, 
            we will surely meet at the finish.
